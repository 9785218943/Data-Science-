    "The Silhouette Coefficient measures how similar an object is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation).

    "\n",
    "The Calinski-Harabasz Index evaluates the ratio of between-cluster variance to within-cluster variance. Higher values indicate better-defined clusters. It is calculated by comparing the dispersion of points between clusters to the dispersion of points within clusters.\n",

    "\n",
    "Sensitivity to Class Imbalance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy is sensitive to class imbalance, where one class significantly outnumbers the others. In such cases, a model may achieve high accuracy by simply predicting the majority class, but it may perform poorly on the minority class.\n",

    "\n",
    "Accuracy treats all misclassifications equally, regardless of the practical impact or cost associated with different types of errors. In many real-world scenarios, the cost of false positives and false negatives may vary.\n",
    "Addressing: Use metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, which provide insights into false positives and false negatives separately. Additionally, consider incorporating cost-sensitive learning approaches or custom loss functions that account for misclassification costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doesn't Distinguish Between Types of Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy lumps false positives and false negatives together, making it challenging to understand the specific types of errors a model is making. Understanding these errors is crucial for improving model performance.\n",
    "Addressing: Examine precision and recall individually to understand the trade-offs between false positives and false negatives. This information can guide adjustments to the model or the decision threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not Suitable for Imbalanced Classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "In imbalanced datasets, where one class is rare, accuracy may be high simply because the model predicts the majority class most of the time. This can give a false sense of good performance.\n",
    "Addressing: Use metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, or AUC-ROC, which provide a more nuanced assessment of the model's performance, especially in imbalanced settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependence on Decision Threshold:\n",
    "\n",
    "The classification threshold affects the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. Accuracy can be misleading if the threshold is not chosen appropriately.\n",
    "Addressing: Evaluate the performance across multiple threshold values and consider metrics like the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve or precision-recall curve to understand the model's behavior across a range of decision thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inability to Reflect Prediction Confidence:\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy does not consider the model's confidence in its predictions. In situations where the model is uncertain or provides low-confidence predictions, accuracy may not adequately capture prediction reliability.\n",
    "Addressing: Consider using uncertainty estimation techniques or calibration methods to assess the model's confidence in its predictions. Brier Score or log likelihood may be used to evaluate prediction confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not Informative in Multiclass Problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "In multiclass classification, accuracy may not provide insights into the model's performance on individual classes. It treats all classes equally, even if some are more important than others.\n",
