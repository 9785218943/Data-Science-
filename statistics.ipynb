    "It is measure of average of all value in a sample set.\n",
    "For example,\n",

    "Measure of Variability is also known as measure of dispersion and used to describe variability in a sample or population. In statistics, there are three common measures of variability as:\n",

    "Inferential Statistics makes inference and prediction about population based on a sample of data taken from population. It generalizes a large dataset and applies probabilities to draw a conclusion. It is simply used for explaining meaning of descriptive stats.
